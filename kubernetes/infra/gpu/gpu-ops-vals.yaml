# Node Feature Discovery: By default, NFD runs on all nodes to label them.
# If you REALLY only want it on the GPU node, set this:

      compute-type: gpu
  master:
    nodeSelector:
      compute-type: gpu

  # If you want to gather features from ALL nodes, omit the nodeSelector here
  # or set it to something else. But if your goal is strictly "only run on clemenza,"
  # you can keep it like this.
